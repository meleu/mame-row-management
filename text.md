## What is the MAME ROW?

MAME ROW stands for **MAME** **R**andom **O**f the **W**eek. We randomly select an arcade game from the 0.78 MAME Reference Set to play on the week. The idea is to play games we've never played before, interact with other forum members, post hi-scores, share game strategies, fun facts, and (the most important) **HAVE FUN!**

**There's no need to use RetroPie to join the MAME ROW! You can play it on any platform you want.**

Every Monday we create a topic at the "General Discussion and Gaming" forum section with the 3 random games to be voted. And on Wednesday we check the result.

The current week's game thread is just where there are more people interacting/talking about the game(s). Feel free to post your hi-score (or any content about the game) anytime you want on the previous "rounds" topics (links below).

**These "rules" are constantly being improved!**
