## What is the MAME ROW?

MAME ROW stands for **MAME** **R**andom **O**f the **W**eek. We randomly select an arcade game from the 0.78 MAME ROMset to play on the week. The idea is to play games we've never played before, interact with other forum members, post hi-scores, share game strategies, fun facts, and (the most important) **HAVE FUN!**
